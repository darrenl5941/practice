                        <p>Batpanzee start off as babies that are similar to chimpanzees but without the characteristics of a bat. The fully grown batpanzee will be able to fly and use bat traits for survival in their environment.

                        <p>The chimpanzees have furry hairs that cover most of their body. The inner systems of the Chimpanzee are significantly similar to the human but their skeletal system is way different</p>

                        <p>front limbs, similar to the bat, that provide the power of flight. A bats wing membrane extends from the arms to the legs of the creature.

                        <p>Batpanzee also have large ears that are like a bat. The ears move back and forth in production of sonar signals. Sonar signals are important for navigating and getting away from predators.</p>

                        <p>The diet of our species is that they are fruit eaters and seed eaters. The batpanzee flies around looking for fruits during the night and has amazing stamina to do so. </p>
